# Job_Portal

A job portal is an internet-based platform that links businesses and job searchers. It provides a centralized area where people can look for jobs, apply for jobs, and track their applications. With options to narrow searches by parameters like job title, region, and income range, these portals offer a vast database of job ads from a variety of industries, locales, and experience levels. Employers can create corporate profiles to display their culture and employment openings, while users can construct profiles to highlight their qualifications, experience, and educational background. Job searchers can apply immediately through the portals, follow the progress of their application, and get alerts when new possibilities become available. These streamlines the application process. Through the site, employers can handle applications, set up interviews, and get in touch with applicants.
